This folder contains information from the competitive coding class taught by Andrew Carr and Mitchell Probst during the BYU Winter 2018 semester. There were two main focuses during class this semester: teaching competitive coding to prepare for the ACM and introducing students to Machine Learning and sklearn.

# Administration
The class was setup with all of the competitive coding being run through Hackerrank using an e-mail account we created for this purpose:<br>
Username: acme.coding.competition@gmail.com<br>
Password: Ask your ACME professor.

If you are NOT part of the BYU ACME curriculum, but want access to the Hackerrank problems that were created by us, please feel free to send either one of us an e-mail at: mitchellprobst@gmail.com or andrewcarr06@gmail.com.

Future classes may choose to re-use the same contests, because Hackerrank will allow you to modify start/end times of a contest, however we found no way to erase the leaderboard, so it will become critical to closely track each user and their performance on the Vat and on the blitzes..

The class had two core components: Competitive Programming (The Vat) and Introduction to Machine Learning.

# Competitive Coding (The Vat)
Although the 2017 Fall Semester wasn't a pre-requisite for this class, we did assume that most people in the class at this point had at least passed the first semester of the ACME junior core, and as such have a deeper understanding of Python in comparison to our expectations for students last semester.  There was one pre-ACME student in our class who did need syntax help, but was still a bright student and performed well.

[The Vat](https://www.hackerrank.com/the-vat) was a huge collection of problems ranging from Easy-Advanced. We made each easy problem worth 2 points, medium problems worth between 4 and 6, and hard problems worth 10.  There were 2 bonus advanced problems worth up to 20 points. Students were expected to earn 120 points by the end of the semester in order to receive full credit for the Vat.  The Vat consisted of 20% of the student's grade and so the formula used to determine the amount of points was (Points Earned by Students / 6 ), because (120 / 6 = 20).  Students could earn an additional 5 extra credit points if they earned more than 120 points.

The breakdown of problems in the Vat with native hackerrank links if applicable:
## Easy

## Medium

## Hard

## Advanced

Much class time was dedicated to working on the Hard problems together, and solutions for these problems is available in this repository [here](https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics/Advanced-Programming/tree/master/2018_WinterMaterials/SolutionsToHardProblems).

# Introduction to Machine Learning

We wanted to dedicate a portion of class giving students an opportunity to begin coding up ML Algorithms to give juniors exposure to sklearn, and to give senior's more confidence in their ability to use sklearn.  We did not cover any theoretics behind these Algorithms, we simply told them what they were useful for and provided examples. During the semester we covered classification, clustering, regression, and dimensionality reduction.

## Classification

## Clustering

## Regression

## Dimensionality Reduction.

# Blitzes
No competitive coding class is complete without blitzes to simulate an ACM Competition environment. We held several blitzes throughout the semester to give students additional practice.

## TODO: Put all Blitzes Here.
